                            WebAuth To-Do List

Protocol:

 * WEBAUTH-108: Replace (or supplement; backwards compatibility will be
   necessary for a long time) the WebAuth protocol with a new protocol
   built on top of OpenID Connect (or OAuth 2.0) to make it easier to
   implement WebAuth servers and clients and to allow WebAuth to be more
   usable for program-to-program authentication.

 * WEBAUTH-27: Currently, there is no good logout strategy other than
   closing the browser, since the user remains logged in to each web site
   they've visited even if they go to the logout page on the weblogin
   server and destroy their global credentials.  The best solution to this
   proposed so far is to maintain global state on the WebKDC servers
   (shared between them somehow) and to have the WebAuth servers query the
   WebKDC to see whether the credentials are still valid.  This is a lot
   of work and raises some basic questions (such as, is HTTPS too slow for
   that query from the WebAuth server).

 * WEBAUTH-28: In the meantime, having the WebAuth logout handler
   automatically redirect to the weblogin logout page might ameliorate
   some of the problems.

 * WEBAUTH-6: Allow a WebAuth Application Server to specify that
   authentication should be done using a particular instance (and perhaps
   only a particular realm?) so that the WebLogin server knows to manage a
   different set of single sign-on credentials for that user.  This allows
   applications with specific credential requirements to not interfere
   with a user's other logins.

 * WEBAUTH-29: Rather than using our own Kerberos ticket serialization
   format, store tickets in the form that would be used when forwarding
   tickets, thus letting the Kerberos library do the encoding and decoding
   for us.

 * WEBAUTH-30: Use a better key for the HMAC than the encryption key of
   the token.

 * WEBAUTH-31: Redo the WebKDC XML protocol to look more like a modern web
   services interface.

 * WEBAUTH-32: User request: Currently, WebAuth always appends ?WEBAUTHR
   even if there's already an ? in the URL, which means that applications
   that want to do WebAuth themselves cannot do normal CGI parsing of the
   URL.  Just changing this would break backward compatibility, so a new
   option needs to be added to the request token allowing the
   implementation to request proper CGI syntax be used in the URL.  This
   option should probably be on by default with new versions of
   mod_webauth, since it's cleaner and doesn't cause any harm.

 * WEBAUTH-103: Switch to URL-safe base-64 encoding for tokens.  This
   should be done in combination with some of the other changes for use of
   ? in URLs as a bundle of new-format token changes.

 * WEBAUTH-42: Stop including addresses in serialized Kerberos tickets and
   figure out what to do about the is_skey attribute.

 * WEBAUTH-39: Change encoded timestamps on the wire to be 64-bit times so
   that we don't have a year 2038 problem.

General:

 * WEBAUTH-34: Currently, all module errors are logged with ap_log_error.
   It looks like we should be using ap_log_rerror when there's a request
   available and ap_log_cerror (but only with Apache 2.0.55 and later)
   when there's a connection available.  This would probably include more
   useful details in the logs.

 * WEBAUTH-35: We're always passing a status of zero to all calls to
   ap_log_error, but in some cases we do have an error status that we
   should be passing in.

 * WEBAUTH-36: Support Apache 2.4 TRACE log levels and deprecate
   WebAuthDebug, WebAuthLdapDebug, and WebKdcDebug in favor of TRACE
   unless there are places where they really go to a lot of extra work.
   (And even then, is there a way for us to query if that log level is
   enabled?)

 * WEBAUTH-86: Generalize the option parsing code so that all three
   modules can use the same infrastructure.  The best way to do this is
   probably to auto-generate most of the code from a separate description
   of the options.

 * WEBAUTH-107: Write an authentication provider for Shibboleth that
   implements the WebAuth protocol natively, and using that, express to
   WebAuth the final destination of the Shibboleth authentication,
   allowing the WebLogin server to make more interesting decisions.  This
   also would eliminate the need to front the Shibboleth IdP with an
   Apache server and would be a natural extension of the work already done
   in the native Java implementation.

 * WEBAUTH-131: Missing configuration directives should not be a fatal
   error for any of the Apache modules, since Apache doesn't provide a
   good way of reporting and handling that error properly.  Instead, we
   should accept the configuration but reject any use of the module.  This
   will also allow us to enable the modules by default when installed as
   Debian packages.

libwebauth:

 * WEBAUTH-41: Add locking to the code reading and writing keyrings so
   that two processes don't simultaneously update a keyring.

 * WEBAUTH-46: Support configuration of options for initial Kerberos
   tickets, such as ticket lifetime.  We also probably want to suppress
   some options by default that we never use.

 * WEBAUTH-48: Format times properly when reporting errors about expired
   or stale tokens from token decoding.

 * WEBAUTH-115: Split the app and request tokens into two separate structs
   in the library API.  We have to continue to use the same encoding on
   the wire, but we can at least not subject the library users to the
   problem.

 * WEBAUTH-116: Implement automatic encoding for enums and unions and use
   that to replace the custom encoding and decoding code for tokens.

 * WEBAUTH-122: Support enterprise principal names.

 * WEBAUTH-132: Support setting persistent factors from the userinfo call
   as well as the validate call.

 * WEBAUTH-133: Support passing parameters to the user information service
   with JSON instead of an ordered list.

 * WEBAUTH-134: Decode factors directly into struct webauth_factors when
   decoding tokens.

 * WEBAUTH-135: Support obtaining the password expiration time from the
   Kerberos KDC reply if the relevant functions are available and fill in
   that field even if we don't have a user information service or it
   doesn't provide us with that information.

 * WEBAUTH-141: Add support for FAST if the Kerberos libraries support it.

 * WEBAUTH-143: Add a webauth_factors_add API and use it for the userinfo
   code.

 * WEBAUTH-144: Add the necessary Autoconf glue to allow us to use bool in
   public headers.

mod_webauth:

 * WEBAUTH-94: Rewrite the service token management in mod_webauth to be
   clearer about object lifetimes.  This will probably require adding
   support for child contexts and copying the keyring back into the parent
   context so that we can destroy the child context and free any transient
   memory.

 * WEBAUTH-49: Provide a way to force reauthentication of a user who has
   valid credentials but ones that are about to expire, and apply it only
   to GET requests and not POST requests.  This would be useful for wikis,
   for example, where expired credentials will usually destroy whatever
   work the user is trying to save.

 * WEBAUTH-50: If mod_webauth obtains a proxy token instead of an id token
   and WebAuthSubjectAuthType is set to krb5, mod_webauth needs to request
   an id token from the WebKDC and then verify it rather than simply
   trusting the identity in the proxy token.

 * WEBAUTH-52: Check the Cookie header for multiple webauth_at cookies and
   try each of them.  This works around a bug in IE 7 where bar.com
   cookies are sent to foo.bar.com as well as the foo.bar.com cookies.

 * WEBAUTH-53: Support setting request headers in addition to or instead
   of environment variables, which will help when using proxy_http to, for
   example, a Tomcat server.

 * WEBAUTH-54: Stop requiring the trailing ; at the end of the token when
   that's the end of the URL.  It is stripped in some obscure situations
   by IE when using header redirects, and in general ; is a separator
   rather than a terminator.  If the token is truncated, we'll catch that
   anyway during decoding.

 * WEBAUTH-15: User request: Provide a way to require additional factors
   only when coming from a certain IP address or IP address range.  This
   allows multifactor restrictions only for off-campus addresses, for
   example.  This may be easier with the Apache 2.4 rework of the
   authorization infrastructure.

 * WEBAUTH-33: Validation of Kerberos authenticators in mod_webauth just
   blindly does a krb5_aname_to_localname and then compares against the
   subject.  The decision of whether to strip the realm may be more
   complex than that.  Figure out the right thing to do here, which is not
   obvious; perhaps require that REMOTE_USER be a full principal name if
   krb5 authenticators are used?

 * WEBAUTH-136: Convert the factor requirements to require directives so
   that they can be used with the new authorization math support in Apache
   2.4.

mod_webauthldap:

 * WEBAUTH-55: User request: There's no inherent reason why
   mod_webauthldap needs to be limited to working with mod_webauth.  Allow
   additional auth types to be processed, or remove auth-type restrictions
   entirely and just rely on require privgroup.  This will also require
   using REMOTE_USER instead of WEBAUTH_USER and, for use with
   mod_auth_kerb, dealing with a REMOTE_USER that's qualified with the
   realm.

 * WEBAUTH-56: User request: It would be nice to support multiple keytabs
   and different credentials in different virtual hosts so that the server
   would switch credentials and see different data depending on the
   context.  This would require a significant reworking of the internals.

 * WEBAUTH-53: Support setting request headers in addition to or instead
   of environment variables, which will help when using proxy_http to, for
   example, a Tomcat server.

 * WEBAUTH-2: Support configuring multiple LDAP servers to query so that
   failover is supported.

 * WEBAUTH-124: Clean up the Apache 2.4 support and improve the way that
   the Apache version conditionals are handled.

mod_webkdc:

 * WEBAUTH-60: Ensure there is a proper return from a password login for
   an expired password so that it can be recognized and acted on by the
   WebLogin server.

 * WEBAUTH-61: A better error message when one talks to the WebKDC
   directly with a browser would be nice.  The current message is rather
   baffling, and it would be good to tell the naive user to set up an
   application server or weblogin server.

 * WEBAUTH-62: Write a custom merging function for WebKdcLocalRealms so
   that the keywords are preserved properly.  If a keyword is set, that
   should override any list of realms, but if both the old and new
   configuration contain list of realms, they should be combined.

 * WEBAUTH-63: Support an "any" option for WebKdcPermittedRealms so that
   the default can be explicitly set (possibly overriding an earlier
   explicit list).

 * WEBAUTH-64: Improve logging for better metrics analysis.  More clearly
   indicate success versus failure, log clearly whether authentication was
   via username/password or via a single sign-on cookie, and find a way to
   differentiate between trusted Apache authentication and single sign-on.

 * WEBAUTH-12: Investigate implementing the GSSAPI-RPC protocol for the
   WebKDC.

 * WEBAUTH-109: Rather than maintaining two parsers, include the possible
   tokens we would issue to the WAS in the return from the WebKDC so that
   the WebLogin server can choose whether to tell the user about them.
   This will let us remove the token.acl parser in WebLogin.

WebLogin:

 * WEBAUTH-65: When going to a site with multiple pieces of content
   protected by WebAuth, the browser seems to go to WebLogin multiple
   times, and for some of those times there's an error "no cookie, even
   after redirection" in the logs.  Figure out what's going on and fix it.

 * WEBAUTH-67: Display a message if the password prompt is forced in order
   to get a TGT for credential delegation to the destination site.

 * WEBAUTH-9: Add a web services interface for the WebLogin login process
   and documentation for how to parse the redirect URL and make the login
   request, returning the return URL.

 * WEBAUTH-68: The error page should return the appropriate HTTP error
   code instead of success.

 * WEBAUTH-69: Incorporate the Stanford advanced settings page into the
   included WebLogin scripts, used to set the cookie saying to use
   Negotiate-Auth.

 * WEBAUTH-118: In support of localization and site customization,
   WebLogin should not be generating any error strings in the Perl code
   where possible.  Instead, it should set parameters that are used on the
   login template to display appropriate text.  Move the remaining error
   messages into the template.

 * WEBAUTH-128: Rework the WebLogin implementation strategy to either stop
   using CGI::Application parameters for per-query data or to collect them
   in a single parameter that can be more easily cleared.

 * WEBAUTH-130: Support displaying the last password change date for a
   user if they enter an incorrect password, as a reminder that they've
   recently changed their password.  This would allow matching the
   behavior of Google authentication.

 * WEBAUTH-125: Fix parsing of the return data from the remctl calls to
   send multifactor messages.  The current parsing doesn't take apart the
   XML document and retrieve the actual status result.

 * WEBAUTH-145: Support remembering the username in a cookie.

 * WEBAUTH-153: Remember the setting of the "use this computer regularly"
   checkbox via a cookie.  Specifically, if the user says single sign-on
   cookies should *not* be retained on this system, remember that choice
   and change the default.

Perl Modules:

 * WEBAUTH-105: To the extent that they will survive, all the WebKDC::*
   modules are misnamed and need to be renamed into the
   WebAuth::WebLogin::* namespace.  WebLogin should be renamed
   WebAuth::WebLogin.

 * WEBAUTH-123: Add Perl WebKDC implementation.

 * WEBAUTH-137: Include in the distribution as much as possible of the
   Stanford user information service implementation as a basis upon which
   other sites can write their own.

Scripts:

 * WEBAUTH-146: Provide a script or library to do synthentic transaction
   probes against a WebLogin server.  (This by necessity will require
   screen scraping of the login HTML.)

 * WEBAUTH-147: Provide a log analysis script for WebKDC logs that
   determines peek usage.

 * WEBAUTH-148: Incorporate a script to obtain webkdc-proxy tokens from
   the WebKDC and display information about them.

 * WEBAUTH-149: Provide a script to take apart a token, given the keyring
   that encrypted it, and display information about the token and its
   contents.

 * WEBAUTH-155: Provide a script that generates the HTML pages for all
   WebLogin page flow paths.

Test Suite:

 * WEBAUTH-71: A test suite (and a redesign of the code so that it can be
   tested) is desperately needed for all the code currently embedded in
   Apache modules.

 * WEBAUTH-111: Add better tests for the Kerberos libwebauth functions.

 * WEBAUTH-121: Rewrite tests for the Apache modules to avoid using lots
   of separate directories, merge the Perl code into a more manageable
   structure, and update the coding style.

 * WEBAUTH-126: Generate C token tests from the Perl configuration data.

 * WEBAUTH-138: Generate the WebKDC login tests from Perl configuration
   data.

 * WEBAUTH-139: Rewrite the userinfo tests to be data-driven.

 * WEBAUTH-150: Determine how to do test coverage analysis for the C test
   suite and add coverage analysis to testing.

 * WEBAUTH-151: Script the analysis of valgrind output from
   check-valgrind.

Documentation:

 * WEBAUTH-73: Rewrite the protocol specification to provide a
   better-structured and more complete introduction to the protocol and
   defining terms earlier and more consistently.

 * WEBAUTH-88: Document that numeric values of 0 are equivalent to the
   attribute not being set for all tokens on the wire.  This is the
   assumption made by the Perl API, and it seems like it should be
   generally valid for all tokens.

 * WEBAUTH-74: Describe the multifactor design and implementation in the
   protocol specification, particularly including the criteria used when
   deciding whether to merge factors together as initial factors.

 * WEBAUTH-76: Write design notes / internals documentation for how
   WebAuth is put together.

 * WEBAUTH-77: Update the docs/test-plan document and check it against the
   current implementation and the set of things that can be tested (such
   as SPNEGO and advanced configuration).

 * WEBAUTH-78: Document the multifactor page flow in docs/weblogin-flow.

 * WEBAUTH-79: API documentation for libwebauth.

 * WEBAUTH-83: Write a full WebAuth manual (probably in Publican).

 * WEBAUTH-89: The protocol says that the subject should not be included
   in id tokens with a subject authenticator type of krb5, but we've
   always sent a subject and just ignored it in mod_webauth.  Modify the
   protocol to indicate that the subject can be included in this case and
   the WAS may choose to trust it rather than validating the authenticator
   (since the choice of requested credentials was the WAS's anyway.)

 * WEBAUTH-154: Write XML schemas for all of the XML documents that the
   WebAuth components exchange, including the interactions with the user
   information service.

Style:

 * WEBAUTH-80: The mod_webauthldap module needs a lot of formatting and
   coding style cleanup.

 * WEBAUTH-81: All of WebAuth needs a general dead code removal pass and
   evaluation of all the places marked FIXME, spawning either entries for
   this list or removal as unimportant.

 * WEBAUTH-120: Update coding style for the WebAuth Perl modules.

 * WEBAUTH-140: Change wai_error_set to return the new error code and use
   that to simplify some of the error handling logic throughout the code
   base.

 * WEBAUTH-142: Add function annotations to the API (particularly alloc).

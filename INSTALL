                    WebAuth Installation Instructions

OVERVIEW

    These installation instructions are for the typical WebAuth user who
    wants to set up a web server with content protected by WebAuth and
    take advantage of an existing site WebAuth infrastructure (including a
    login server and WebKDC).  For details on how to install the site
    infrastructure, which is more complex and only has to be done once at
    each site, see doc/install-webkdc.

    If you have installed the Debian or Ubuntu packages, please see
    /usr/share/doc/libapache2-webauth/README.Debian.gz, which is more
    complete and specific for using those packages than these
    instructions.

PREREQUISITES

    Make sure that you have all of the required packages installed.
    WebAuth is implemented as Apache 2.x modules, and therefore requires
    an installation of Apache 2.0.43 or later built with SSL and dynamic
    modules.  There are reports of problems with Apache 2.0.x as shipped
    with Solaris 10 x86, so Apache 2.2 or later is recommended.  It also
    requires Kerberos, cURL, and OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later (for AES support).
    See README for more version dependencies.

    In order to build the LDAP module, Cyrus SASL 2.x and OpenLDAP are
    also required.

    Note that all of these packages should be installed on local disk.  We
    do not recommend using libraries installed on shared file systems such
    as AFS, since the reliability of your web server will then be tied to
    the availability of that remote file system.  The required libraries
    aren't large, particularly given the average size of modern disks.

    If you build your own Apache 2.x server, you'll want to use a
    configure invocation like:

        ./configure --enable-so --enable-ssl --with-ssl=/usr/local

    (changing the last if your OpenSSL is installed somewhere else).  Any
    pre-packaged Apache server should be built this way.

    If you are building a Git clone of the WebAuth distribution (as
    opposed to a packaged release, which already includes the generated
    configure script), cd to the top of the source tree and run:

        ./autogen

    to generate the configure script.  Autoconf 2.64 and Automake 1.11 or
    later are required, Perl is required to generate the man pages, and
    xml2rfc is required to build the protocol documentation.

CONFIGURING THE BUILD

    Run configure.  The command will look something like:

        ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs \
            --with-openssl=/usr/local --with-ldap=/usr/local

    configure will detect various things about your system and will
    generate the makefiles and include files required to build WebAuth.

    Adjust the paths to match where you have installed those packages.
    You can omit --with-openssl and --with-ldap if the packages are
    installed in locations automatically searched by your compiler and
    linker (which will be the case if you're using Linux and the packages
    that come with your Linux distribution).

    You can omit --with-apxs if the right version of apxs is in your path.

    Normally, configure will use krb5-config to determine the flags to use
    to compile with your Kerberos GSS-API libraries.  If krb5-config isn't
    found, it will look for the standard Kerberos libraries in locations
    already searched by your compiler.  If the krb5-config script first in
    your path is not the one corresponding to the Kerberos libraries you
    want to use or if your Kerberos libraries and includes aren't in a
    location searched by default by your compiler, you need to specify
    --with-krb5=PATH:

        ./configure --with-krb5=/usr/local

    You can also individually set the paths to the include directory and
    the library directory with --with-krb5-include and --with-krb5-lib.
    You may need to do this if Autoconf can't figure out whether to use
    lib, lib32, or lib64 on your platform.  If these flags are used, any
    krb5-config script is ignored.

    To specify a particular krb5-config script to use, either set the
    PATH_KRB5_CONFIG environment variable or pass it to configure like:

        ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/path/to/krb5-config

    To not use krb5-config and force library probing even if there is a
    krb5-config script on your path, set PATH_KRB5_CONFIG to a nonexistent
    path:

        ./configure PATH_KRB5_CONFIG=/nonexistent

    Similarly, normally configure will use curl-config to determine the
    flags to use to compile with cURL.  If curl-config isn't found, it
    will look for the standard cURL library in the locations already
    searched by your compiler.  If the curl-config script first in your
    path is not the one corresponding to the cURL libraries you want to
    use or if your cURL libraries and includes aren't in a location
    searched by default by your compiler, you need to specify
    --with-curl or --with-curl-libs and --with-curl-include as above.
    Similarly, you can pass CURL_CONFIG to the configure script to change
    which curl-config script is used.

    You may optionally build Perl bindings for libwebauth by passing the
    --enable-perl option to configure.  If you do this, whatever version
    of Perl is found first on your path will be used to build the Perl
    bindings.  You can override this check by setting the environment
    variable PERL to the full path of the Perl binary that you want to
    use.

    Pass --enable-silent-rules to configure for a quieter build (similar
    to the Linux kernel).

    To change the compiler, set the environment variable CC before
    running configure.  Similarly, you can set CFLAGS to whatever
    compiler flags you wish to build WebAuth with.  See:

        ./configure --help

    for information about other available options.

    WebAuth's library will by default be installed in /usr/local/lib, its
    utility programs will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and its modules
    will be installed in /usr/local/libexec/apache2/modules.  To change
    those locations, pass the --prefix option to configure with whatever
    path you want to serve as the installation root.  You can use
    --libexecdir to set the parent directory of the module installation.
    The modules will be installed in an apache2/modules subdirectory of
    that directory.

    The install location of the Perl modules will be derived from Perl's
    configuration and is not affected by --prefix.

COMPILING AND TESTING

    Build WebAuth by running:

        make

    You can then also run:

        make check

    to have WebAuth build and run some internal consistency checks to make
    sure that the library functions are working correctly.  In order to do
    more than limited tests of the low-level routines, you should first
    create a keytab for testing use containing the key for a principal in
    your local realm.  See tests/config/README for instructions on what to
    create and where to place the files.  If you are building the Perl
    bindings and modules, see perl/t/data/README for instructions about
    further configuration required to test the WebAuth Perl bindings and
    WebLogin code.

    If a test case fails, please run the that individual test case with
    verbose output using:

        tests/runtests -o <name-of-test>

    and send the WebAuth maintainers the output when reporting the
    problem.

INSTALLATION

    Install WebAuth with:

        make install

    This will install the shared library, the Apache modules, and
    optionally the the Perl bindings and WebLogin code as a Perl module.
    At this point, the software is available but will not be used.
    Without additional configuration changes to your server, WebAuth is
    not active and will not protect any web pages.

CONFIGURATION

  Apache Directives

    Add Apache directives for WebAuth to your httpd.conf or equivalent
    file.  The basic set of directives are:

        LoadModule webauth_module \
            /usr/local/lib/apache2/modules/mod_webauth.so

        WebAuthKeyringAutoUpdate on
        WebAuthKeyringKeyLifetime 30d

        WebAuthLoginURL "https://<your-webkdc>/login/"
        WebAuthWebKdcURL "https://<your-webkdc>/webkdc-service/"
        WebAuthWebKdcPrincipal service/webkdc
        WebAuthKeyring conf/webauth/keyring
        WebAuthKeytab conf/webauth/keytab
        WebAuthServiceTokenCache conf/webauth/service_token.cache

        WebAuthSSLRedirect on

    In all instances above, replace <your-webkdc> with the hostname of the
    WebKDC server at your site.  conf/sample-webauth.conf contains a
    heavily-commented version of these directives.

    If you are testing a beta release, please also add:

        WebAuthDebug on
        LogLevel debug  # change your existing setting to debug

    so that your server will generate more complete logs if anything goes
    wrong.  This may also be useful if this is the first time you've
    installed a WebAuth server.

    Also, if you are using a self-signed certificate with your WebKDC,
    you'll need to copy it to a local file (like conf/webauth/webkdc.cert)
    and add the following directive:

        WebAuthWebKdcSSLCertFile conf/webauth/webkdc.cert

    so that the WebAuth Apache module can verify the WebKDC.

  Keytab and Keyring

    Make sure that the conf/webauth directory exists:

        cd <apache-root>
        mkdir -p conf/webauth

    where <apache-root> is the root of your Apache 2.x installation.  This
    directory must be writable by the running web server (and by the child
    servers, not just the main server), so if you have User and Group
    directives in your httpd.conf, <apache-root>/conf/webauth should be
    writable by that user and group.

    You can put these files somewhere else if you wish.  Just change
    WebAuthKeyring and WebAuthKeytab in your Apache configuration.  Only
    the keyring directory and file need to be writable by the Apache
    process.  The keytab just needs to be readable.

    Then, install a keytab in <apache-root>/conf/webauth/keytab (or
    elsewhere if you chose to put it somewhere else).  The recommended
    principal name is webauth/<your-system> where <your-system> is the
    fully qualified, all-lowercase name of your system.  How to obtain a
    keytab will depend on your local site and how your Kerberos KDC is set
    up.

    After installing the keytab, make sure that it is readable by the user
    that the web server runs as.  (It may have been created only readable
    by root.)

  SSL Certificate

    Install an SSL certificate for your system, either a self-signed
    certificate or one signed by whatever certificate authority you
    normally use.  All access to WebAuth-protected web pages must be
    through SSL to preserve the security of the WebAuth authentication
    tokens.

    If you have not installed an SSL certificate before, there are
    instructions available as part of the mod_ssl FAQ.  See
    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/ssl/ssl_faq.html#realcert>.  Debian
    users can quickly install a self-signed certificate with the
    apache2-ssl-certificate utility that comes with the Apache package.

    If you are using the Debian or Ubuntu Apache packages, you will need
    to explicitly enable the SSL Apache module with a2enmod ssl.  You will
    then also need to configure the location of your SSL certificate and
    key file.  For Debian and Ubuntu, the best location for the
    certificate is /etc/ssl/certs, and for the key is /etc/ssl/private.
    Example configuration:

        SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/<hostname>.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/<hostname>.key
        SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!ADH:!SSLv2:@STRENGTH
        SSLProtocol all -SSLv2

    The last two configuration lines disable weak SSL ciphers.  You can
    use similar configuration directives for other operating systems, but
    may need to change SSLCertificateFile and SSLCertificateKeyFile.

    See /usr/share/doc/apache2.2-common/README.Debian.gz for more
    information about configuring SSL on Debian and Ubuntu systems,
    including how to generate and use self-signed certificates.

    If your certificate came with intermediate CA certificates, you may
    need to save them on your system (/etc/ssl/certs is recommended for
    Debian and Ubuntu systems) and configure that file in Apache as well
    with:

        SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/<chain-name>.crt

    replacing <chain-name> with something documenting the intermediate CA
    certificate chain stored in that file.

  Basic Testing

    Restart the server to pick up the configuration changes, and check
    your error log for any errors indicating a problem with the WebAuth
    installation.  If you are using the default Apache 2.x setup, be sure
    to start Apache with apachectl startssl to enable SSL.

    At this point, WebAuth is available to your web server and will be
    initialized when your server starts, but is not as yet being used to
    protect any web pages.  This can now be configured.  For the most
    basic use of WebAuth, just requiring a valid user login to view a
    portion of the web pages served out by the server, add the lines:

        AuthType WebAuth
        require valid-user

    to the <Directory> block for the portion of your web site that you
    wish to protect.  (To restrict access by privilege group, see the
    instructions below on setting up the LDAP module.)

  LDAP Configuration

    If you want to have your WebAuth server do LDAP directory queries,
    either to put directory information into environment variables or to
    use LDAP-based privilege groups for access control, you need to
    configure the mod_webauthldap module.  The basic set of directives
    are:

        LoadModule webauthldap_module \
            /usr/local/lib/apache2/modules/mod_webauthldap.so

        WebAuthLdapHost ldap.example.com
        WebAuthLdapBase dc=example,dc=com
        WebAuthLdapAuthorizationAttribute privilegegroup

        WebAuthLdapKeytab conf/webauth/keytab
        WebAuthLdapTktCache conf/webauth/krb5cc_ldap

    The first three configuration settings will vary considerably given
    the name and configuration of your local LDAP server.  For more
    information on what these settings do, see the mod_webauthldap manual.
    Please note that the WebAuth LDAP module only supports Kerberos
    GSS-API binds at this time.

    Once you've added that configuration and restarted Apache, LDAP
    lookups are available to your web server.  This can now be configured.
    To restrict access to a given set of pages by membership in a
    privilege group, add the lines:

        AuthType WebAuth
        require privgroup example:staff

    to the <Directory> or <Location> block for the portion of your web
    site that you wish to protect.  example:staff is whatever privilege
    group you want to use.

    To put various directory attributes related to the current
    authenticated user into the environment, additionally add lines like:

        WebAuthLdapAttribute displayName
        WebAuthLdapAttribute mail

    to the <Directory> or <Location> block.  The attributes can be any
    attributes your server has access to read, and the corresponding
    values from your LDAP server will be put into environment variables of
    the form WEBAUTH_LDAP_<attribute>, or in this case into the variables
    WEBAUTH_LDAP_DISPLAYNAME and WEBAUTH_LDAP_MAIL.

RUNNING THE MODULE TEST SUITE

    You can now test WebAuth if you wish (and if this is the first time
    that you've set up WebAuth, it's recommended).  WebAuth comes with a
    set of test pages that you can use to configure your installation with
    various different configuration options.

    To install this test suite, copy (recursively) the files in
    tests/mod_webauth/conf into your Apache configuration directory and
    the files in tests/mod_webauth/htdocs under your Apache document root.

    Now, edit your httpd.conf file and add the line:

        Include conf/webauth-tests.conf

    and make sure that the basic WebAuth configuration directives are in
    your httpd.conf file as described above, or uncomment them in the
    webauth-tests.conf file.

    After restarting Apache, you should now be able to go to the URL
    https://<your-server>/tests/, where <your-server> is the name of your
    web server, to see the test suite.  Documentation on how to walk
    through all of the tests can be found in doc/test-plan.

CONCLUSION

    Congratulations!  You have a working WebAuth server.  You can now add
    AuthType WebAuth and require valid-user (or require lines for
    particular users, or for groups containing user identities as returned
    by WebAuth) to protect the content served by your web server, and make
    use of the REMOTE_USER or WEBAUTH_USER environment variables in your
    CGI scripts.  You can also use require privgroup directives and
    request directory attributes if you have configured the LDAP module as
    well.

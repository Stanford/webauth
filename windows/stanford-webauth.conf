#
# The following Apache configuration fragment is a sample minimal
# configuration for a WebAuth server, similar to the one given in INSTALL
# but with comments explaining each step of what's going on.

# In the Webauth v3 model, each WebAuth server has to talk to a central
# authentication server called the WebKDC, both to send users to the login
# server and to be able to interpret the tokens that it returns.  Some of
# the directives below are needed to facilitate that behind-the-scenes
# communication.

# The Webauth module is built as a dynamic module by default.  This loads
# it into Apache.
LoadModule webauth_module modules/mod_webauth.so

# Location of the server's private AES keys, used for communication with
# the WebKDC.  Generated and maintained automatically, so it must be
# writable by the Apache server process.
WebAuthKeyring conf/webauth/keyring

# Location of the server's Kerberos v5 keytab.  You need to generate this
# file as part of the installation.
WebAuthKeytab conf/webauth/keytab

# Location of where the service tokens are kept.  These tokens are used to
# authenticate internal communication with the WebKDC.  This file has to
# be writable by the Apache server processes.
WebAuthServiceTokenCache conf/webauth/service_token_cache

# Where the user is redirected to enter username/password.  This is part
# of the site configuration and will be provided by the person who sets up
# the WebKDC for your site.
WebAuthLoginURL https://weblogin.stanford.edu/login/

# URL used for behind-the-scenes communication with the WebKDC.  As above,
# this is part of the site configuration.
WebAuthWebKdcURL https://weblogin.stanford.edu/webkdc-service/

# The service name to use when communicating with the WebKDC.  The below
# is just our recommendation.  The principal name is part of the site
# configuration.
WebAuthWebKdcPrincipal service/webkdc@stanford.edu

# If you uncomment this, anyone who tries to access a WebAuth-protected
# page via HTTP rather than HTTPS will be redirected to HTTPS.
#
# WebAuthSSLRedirect on

# Uncomment this if you want to use "AuthType StanfordAuth" in your
# .htaccess files.  This will allow you to use both StanfordAuth and
# WebAuth with the AuthType directive.
#
# WebAuthAuthType StanfordAuth

# If you are having trouble getting WebAuth to run, you should turn on
# debug.
#
# WebAuthDebug on

# If you are really have trouble getting WebAuth to run, you should turn
# on debug, and also enable the /webauth-status URL, then point your
# browser at it to check on the status of mod_webauth.  You should turn
# off the webauth-status URL when you are done.
#
#<Location /webauth-status>
#   SetHandler webauth
#   Order allow,deny
#   Allow from all
#</Location>

# Example of restricting a location to authenticated users only.  If
# uncommented, all URLs under /private/ would require WebAuth
# authentication to access.
#
#<Location /private/ >
#    AuthType WebAuth
#    Require valid-user
#</Location>

# Example of a logout page for a particular application.  (Note that even
# if the user goes to this page, they will still have their site-wide
# single sign-on cookie, so they will not be completely logged out.  This
# will only destroy their credentials for that particular application.)
# There should also be a web page that this URL corresponds to; WebAuth
# will not generate one internally.
#
# You may want to include on this web page a link to:
#
#     <https://weblogin.stanford.edu/logout>
#
# which will destroy their site-wide single sign-on cookie as well if they
# follow the link.
#
#<Location /logout/ >
#    AllowOverride All
#    WebAuthDoLogout on
#</Location>

# point to the cURL ca-bundle.crt file
WebAuthWebKdcSSLCertFile conf/webauth/ca-bundle.crt

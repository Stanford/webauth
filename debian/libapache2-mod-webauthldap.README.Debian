Introduction
------------

This package contains an Apache module to look up user information in an
LDAP directory using GSS-API binds.  That information can be exported in
the environment or used for authorization.  It is not useful by itself;
your site also needs to be running a WebAuth infrastructure including a
separate WebKDC and weblogin server, and you must be using mod_webauth for
access control.  See the libapache2-mod-webkdc and webauth-weblogin
packages for the WebKDC server and weblogin server and
libapache2-mod-webauth for the authentication module.

You can install the webauth-tests package to get a test suite that you can
use to verify that your installation is working.  See the documentation of
that package for more information.

mod_webauthldap.html.en has the formatted manual, but it expects to be
viewed as part of the Apache documentation tree.  If you wish, you can
install the apache2-doc package and copy this file to:

    /usr/share/doc/apache2-doc/manual/mod

and you will then be able to read it as intended.

See:

    <http://webauth.stanford.edu/>

for more information about WebAuth, including copies of the module manuals
and places to contact to get help with the installation.


Configuring the LDAP Module
---------------------------

Several steps required for configuring this module cannot (easily) be
automated, so it is not active and available immediately after installing
this package.  You must also do the following:

 1. Set up libapache2-mod-webauth following its documentation.  This
    module only works with users authenticated via the mod_webauth module.

 2. Add the following configuration to:

        /etc/apache2/conf-available/webauth.conf

    (or wherever you put the configuration mentioned above):

        WebAuthLdapHost <ldap-server>
        WebAuthLdapBase <ldap-base>

    where <ldap-server> is your local LDAP server name and <ldap-base> is
    the LDAP search base to use (something like dc=example,dc=com).  Your
    local LDAP administrator will be able to provide this information.
    The LDAP server must support GSS-API binds using the credentials
    stored in /etc/webauth/keytab (or a different keytab if you change the
    default module configuration).

 3. If you want to use authorization through privilege groups defined by
    the presence of an LDAP attribute in the record of the authenticated
    user, also add a line like:

        WebAuthLdapAuthorizationAttribute <attribute>

    where <attribute> is a multivalued attribute in directory entries for
    your users that contains all of the privilege groups that that user is
    a member of.

 4. Enable the WebAuth LDAP module:

        a2enmod webauthldap

    and restart Apache:

        apache2ctl graceful

You may now use the WebAuthLdapAttribute directive in <Location>,
<Directory>, or <Files> blocks or .htaccess files to request that
particular LDAP attributes be put into environment variables, and if you
configured a privgroup attribute, you may now use the "require privgroup"
command to restrict access to particular web pages to members of that
privgroup.

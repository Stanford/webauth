Packaged for Debian by Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>            2004-06-23

It was downloaded from:

  <http://webauth.stanford.edu/>

Upstream authors:

  The WebAuth v3 protocol and core implementation was written by Roland
  Schemers, based on design documents by the entire Stanford WebAuth team
  (with considerable work by Tim Torgenrud and Booker Bense) and based in
  part on the functionality of WebAuth v2.5, written and maintained by a
  cast of dozens over the years but most notably Jeff Lewis, Anton
  Ushakov, and Jeanmarie Lucker.

  The mod_webauthldap module was written by Anton Ushakov.

  The configuration and build system and WebAuth packaging was put
  together by Russ Allbery.  Huaqing Zheng provided builds of supporting
  packages and Jonathan Pilat helped greatly with testing.  Xueshan Feng
  oversaw the project.

  The WebAuth package is currently maintained by Russ Allbery.

  Thanks to pod for improvements, particularly to the WebKDC, to make it
  easier to package for a Linux distribution, for the initial Debian
  package build rules, and for generic WebKDC templates suitable for a new
  installation and for use as examples.

  Thanks to Dmitri Priimak for work on cross-realm support, WebLogin
  improvements, and testing of unusual Kerberos realms and principal
  names.
